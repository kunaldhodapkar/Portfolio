					<div class="box special">
						<h2>My Role</h2>
						<p> 
							I was the <strong>Lead Product Designer</strong> in a team of 5, focused on designing 
							AI experiences for older adults (60+) and testing them out in their 
							natural environment. Our team comprised a project manager, 
							two UX researchers, and an engineer.
							<br/><br/>It was a 10 month long project from August 2020 – May 2021.

				<!-- Discovering the Problem -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
						<h5>Chapter 1</h5>
						<h2>Discovering the problem</h2>
							<p>
								We took a user-centered approach to this challenge. 
								We started by understanding users' current context rather 
								than enforcing the latest technologies. UX researchers conducted ethnographic 
								research and interviews to understand their daily routines and 
								points of struggle. They also piloted a study by placing voice AI assistants 
								in couples' homes to know how they naturally interact with it. I helped with data analysis & coding.
							</p>

							<hr/>
							<h3>Our users</h3>
							<p>Our users consisted of an elderly couple, a member 
								(an elder struggling with cognitive decline), 
								and their care partner.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Personas.jpg" alt="Users personas of member and spouse" /></div>
							
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Ethnographic research findings</h3>
							<p>
								In almost 60% of interactions with the conversational 
								assistant, the couples tried to set alarms for medications. 
								Not taking medicines on time can severely impact 
								their long-term health. Globally, 75% of older adults struggle with 
								medication management, sometimes missing critical doses and sometimes 
								taking multiple doses.<br/><br/>
								<strong>From the research, we understood that managing medications 
								was a big pain.</strong><br/><br/>
								I saw an opportunity to build an AI experience to support them with their 
								daily medications. I aligned with the leadership on this idea and formulated 
								the "How Might We" question:
							</p>
							<blockquote>How might we use conversational AI to support millions of elderly 
							adults in managing their daily medications?</blockquote>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Nest.jpg" alt="Google Nest Hub" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 0.8rem;">
								We used Google Nest as our pilot conversational AI for it's ability to handle long-form prompts.

				<!-- Getting deeper Insights -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Chapter 2</h5>
							<h2>Getting deeper insights</h2>
							<p>
								To understand how a new AI intervention can fit into couples' ecosystem, 
								I collaborated with the UX researcher to conduct 
								2 focus groups with 50 couples.
								Goal was to understand their existing medication management 
								strategies. <br/><br/>
								<strong>Important Note:</strong> This project was ongoing while the COVID-19 
								pandemic was at its peak. As older adults are not so adept with technology,
								we had to devise innovative ways to make virtual sessions engaging. 
								Thus, instead of using a traditional Q&A format, 
								we created an interactive quiz.
							</p>
							<br/>
							
							<hr>
							<h3>Systems Thinking</h3>
							<p>
								I also interviewed other teams involved in the 
								program to understand an elderly couple's 
								holistic environment.<br/><br/>
								Members' immediate care network often consisted of spouses 
								and adult children (if local), and the secondary level 
								consisted of a therapeutic team, nurses, and doctors. 
								<br/><br/>
								<strong>The conversational AI was situated in members' 
								immediate vicinity and formed a part of their primary 
								care network.</strong>

							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Care network.jpg" alt="Care network"/></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 0.8rem;">
								Conversational AI was part of the primary care network
							</h6>
							<br/>
							
							<hr>
							<h3>Research Insights</h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>Current medication management systems were not robust:</strong> 
									Couples often used pillboxes to keep track of their 
									medications. They placed pillboxes strategically near the objects of 
									their daily routine, like toothbrush holder or stove. 
									Alarms were ineffective, because they lacked context. As a result, 
									members missed medications often or sometimes overdosed.<br/>
								</li>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Pillbox.jpg" alt="Picture of a pillbox"/></div>
								<br/>
								
								<li><strong>Members thought of AI as a real person, followed advice:</strong> 
									Members thought of conversational AI as a real person talking to them.
									Their mental model of this technology was very different from ours.
									Thus, we had a greater responsibility of designing a skill that's safe.<br/>
								</li>
								<br/>

								<li><strong>Spouses were the keepers:</strong> Members relied heavily on 
									their care partners to check on them about their medications. But when 
									both forgot, it caused the member to miss their dose.<br/>
								</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								Can conversational AI relieve the 
								care partners from the responsibility of reminding members about their 
								medications?

							I formulated the design goals based on the research.
						</p>
						<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Clock icon.png" alt="Clock icon" /></span>
							<h3>Fit seamlessly into existing routine</h3>
							The AI intervention shouldn't compel the elderly couple to form new habits. 
							It should fit seamlessly into their routine. <br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Minus icon.png" alt="Minus icon" /></span>
							<h3> Mitigate the risk of double dosing</h3>The AI system should 
							prompt reflection rather than being a command or suggestion.<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Diverse.png" alt="Multiple scenarios icon" /></span>
							<h3>Accommodate diverse scenarios</h3>Design should be reliable,

				<!-- Mapping probable scenarios -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Chapter 4</h5>
							<h2>Mapping probable scenarios</h2>
							<p>
								To map different scenarios that couples encounter daily 
								and understand their expectations around AI behavior, I 
								partnered with the UX researcher. They suggested to 
								conduct the participatory design activity with 35 couples, 
								where we personified AI as "Rosie-the-robot" from Jetsons. <br/><br/>
								I storyboarded different scenarios and we asked users to help us write the story. 
								What they would want "Rosie-the-robot" to do when such a scenario happens. 
								It was a powerful way to understand user expectations around AI intervention.

							<h3>Expectations From Conversational AI</h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>Persist reminder if busy:</strong> 
									Users mentioned they would want the system 
									to persistently check in with them if they miss 
									the reminder instead of just triggering it once.<br/>
								</li>
								<br/>
								
								<li><strong>Multi-platform design:</strong> 
									Users also mentioned they would like to be 
									reminded on their phone if they are not around 
									at the time of medications.<br/>
								</li>
								<br/>

								<li><strong>Positive reinforcement on task completion:</strong>
									Users mentioned, they would be delighted if AI compliments them
									if they took the medications before the reminder went off.<br/>

							<h3>Technical limitations that impacted design</h3>
							<p>Google Nest Hub is a protected hardware which 
								limited our ability to customize the device. 
								Some limitations that impacted design:
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Integration with third-party pillboxes not supported:</strong> 
										Ideally, we wanted to trigger the reminder only when a 
										member forgets to take his pills, but since Google Nest 
										doesn't support integrations with third-party pillboxes, it limited 
										our ability to make the prompt contextual or store 
										medication history.<br/>
									</li>
									<br/>
									
									<li><strong>Presence sensing:</strong> 
										We wanted to customize the sound of the prompt based on 
										whether someone was present in the room. However, we 
										could not add this customization due to a lack of 
										presence-sensing hardware in Google Nest.<br/>
									</li>
									<br/>
	
									<li><strong>Ability to snooze:</strong> 
										Google restricted our ability to auto-invoke the 
										medication alert based on response history. 
										It had to be either statically invoked by time or 
										explicitly by user speech. Thus, it restricted 
										our ability to add a "snooze" feature to the design.<br/>
									</li>
								</ul>

							<br/>
							<br/>

							<p>
								As multi-modal AI design was still a novel technology, 
								I had to invent new methodologies to design a holistic voice 
								and visual experience.<br/><br/>
								To accommodate various scenarios we could design for, 
								I created a response chart with possible interactions 
								with the AI. I also built a spreadsheet with 
								possible semantic variations for responses to train the ML model.

							<h3>Deployment</h3>
							<p>
								Once I had built the skill for Google Nest Hub, I personalized it to match 
								every couple's medication schedules and <strong>deployed it for 
								15 senior couples for testing.</strong>

						<h2>Final Designs</h2>
						
						<br/>
						<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Designing for safety</h4>
						<p> 
							Members' listened to the AI as it were a real person. Med Companion had to provide context 
							without being overly suggestive as it'd risk double dosing. I carefully structured the 
							prompt to avoid any direct suggestion, instead AI checked-in about 
							the medications to encourage reflection.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Safety.jpg" alt="Illustration of safety" />
						<br/>
						<br/>
						
						<br/>
						<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Name personalization to establish trust</h4>
						<p> 
							Med Companion was personalized for each member and addressed 
							them by name. It served dual purpose, as there were two adults 
							in the house, using names made it clear to the members 
							that the reminder was for them, removing ambiguity. 
							Second, it made them more responsive to the reminder.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Name.jpg" alt="Concept of Name personalization" />
						<br/>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Time personalization for a seamless experience</h4>
						<p> 
							Med Companion was triggered at their medication times for each member. 
							Time personalization allowed it to seamlessly fit into the existing 
							schedules of the couples without being intrusive. Rather than 
							forcing them to take the medications at a specific time, the 
							skill triggered at their medication time.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Time.jpg" alt="Skill triggered at different times for different people"/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						
						<br/>
						<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Positive reinforcement to build sustainable habits</h4>
						<p> 
							Med Companion employed the use of positive reinforcement to 
							build sustainable habits. Conversational AI applauded 
							when the users took before reminder, offered motivation if they forgot.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Motivation.jpg" alt="Applause by AI"/>
						<br/>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Designing for familiarity</h4>
						<p> 
							As Med Companion was a multi-modal skill, the visual 
							interface was designed with supporting visuals 
							and familiar chime to make it easily recognizable.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Familiar.jpg" alt="Same visual cue and chime"/>

				<!-- Impact -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
						<h5>Chapter 7</h5>
						<h2>Impact</h2>
							<p>
								After three weeks of deployment, we conducted semi-structured 
								interviews and analyzed interaction logs to understand the skill 
								performance. The feedback was positive about the conversational AI 
								helping them remember to take their medications.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Quotes.jpg" alt="Quotes from the field"/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							
							<hr/>
							<h3>Qualitative Feedback</h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Applause received mixed feedback:</strong> 
										Some users mentioned that they liked it when AI 
										applauded them when they had taken the medications 
										before the reminder went off; however, some mentioned 
										that they found it patronizing. There was also a 
										mention of the applause volume being too loud.<br/>
									</li>
									<br/>
									
									<li><strong>Conversational AI prevented them from missing medications:</strong> 
										Users recalled instances where they had forgotten to take 
										the medications, but because AI reminded them, they took it.<br/>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							
							<hr/>
							<h3>Quantitative Feedback</h3>
							<p>
								I analyzed interaction logs and found that in 20% of the cases, 
								users had taken the medications after conversational AI 
								had reminded them. Hence, the skill was effective in achieving 
								its objective.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Pie.jpg" alt="Pie chart of the interaction log"/>
							<blockquote>Missed medications had dropped by almost 20% after the skill deployment.</blockquote>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							
							<hr/>
							<h3>✨Outcome✨</h3>
							<p>
								This skill was shipped millions of users with Google Nest Hub devices, 
								so they could customize their own AI assistant for medication management.

				<!-- Learnings -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
						<h5>Chapter 8</h5>
						<h2>Learnings from the experience</h2>
						<br/>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Imperfect solution is better than no solution:</strong> As we worked with closed hardware, we hit technical roadblocks at every step. We had designed a complete solution, but when it came to implementation, we were only able to implement half of it. However, that itself was a huge step forward from before for the couples, as managing medications was a real pain. Our solution could have been better, but it was still helpful. As a designer, there's a desire to ship a perfect solution; however, being mindful of the technical limitations and keeping at the forefront the wish to maximize value for our users can help to break down the perfect vision into achievable milestones.</li><br/>
							<li><strong>Working with a challenging demographic:</strong> This project was my first experience working with the elderly population. It was challenging and rewarding in many respects. Older adults are not good with technology, and even the simplest of tasks, taking a remote survey or allowing remote access via Zoom, was a challenge. However, when we saw the positive impact of our work on their lives, the effort felt worthwhile as we were working with a vulnerable population that is not often focused on in society when it comes to emerging technologies.</li><br/>
							<li><strong>Collaborating remotely:</strong> I planned my week to ensure I covered important topics during my 1:1s with stakeholders. Planning became increasingly important due to the lack of opportunities for small conversations. I also met weekly with the team to catch up on important updates, share progress, and discuss the next steps. I also organized "working sessions" with my teammates if we prepped for participatory design activity. I created a task tracker to align what everyone was working on and shared async updates. Remote collaboration was new, but I was always seeking ways to succeed.</li><br/>
							<li><strong>Tremendous possibilities of multi-modal AI:</strong> Multi-modal AI was a relatively new technology in 2020. However, even at that point, I could realize the immense possibilities with it. I wrote an article sharing my views about the future of AI at that time, predicting that this technology has the potential to percolate almost every sphere of our lives.</li>
