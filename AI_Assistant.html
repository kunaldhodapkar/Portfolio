								Old age brings many challenges, as aging 
								leads to physical and cognitive decline, 
								simplest of tasks become demanding.
								<br/><br/>
								To address this, Emory Medicine partnered with 
								Georgia Tech to design technologies that 
								support independent living among older adults.
							</p>
						</div>

				<!-- My Role -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box special">
						<h2>My Role</h2>
						<p> 
							I was the <strong>Lead Product Designer</strong> focused on designing 
							and testing AI experiences for older adults (60+). It was a 10 month long engagement from August 2020 – May 2021.
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Team.jpg" alt="Project team represented as cats"/></div>
							<blockquote>The AI assistant was deployed to millions of users using Google Nest and Android devices.</blockquote>

				<!-- Discovering the Problem -->
				<section class="container" id="Ch1">
					<div class="box">
						<h5>Chapter 1</h5>
						<h2>Discovering the problem</h2>
							<p>
								We started by understanding users' context. UX researchers conducted ethnographic 
								research and piloted a study by placing Google Nest devices 
								in couples' homes to observe their natural interactions. 
								I helped with data analysis.
							</p>

							<hr/>
							<h3>Our users</h3>
							<p>Our users consisted of an elderly couple, a member 
								(an elder struggling with cognitive decline), 
								and their care partner.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Personas.jpg" alt="Users personas of member and spouse" /></div>
							
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Ethnographic research findings</h3>
							<p>
								Couples set alarms for medications in 60% of their interactions. 
								They also mentioned during interviews that missing critical doses impacted their health.<br/><br/>
								<strong>From the research, we understood that managing medications 
								was a big pain.</strong><br/><br/>
								I saw an opportunity to build an AI experience to support them with their 
								daily medications and aligned with the leadership on this idea.
							</p>
							<blockquote>How might we use conversational AI to support millions of older 
							adults in managing their daily medications?</blockquote>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Nest.jpg" alt="Google Nest Hub" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 0.8rem;">
								We used Google Nest as our pilot conversational AI for it's ability to handle long-form prompts.

				<!-- Getting deeper Insights -->
				<section class="container" id="Ch2">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Chapter 2</h5>
							<h2>Getting deeper insights</h2>
							<p>
								To understand a couple's existing medication management 
								strategies, I collaborated with the UX researcher to conduct 
								2 focus groups with 50 couples.<br/><br/>
								<strong>Important Note:</strong> We conducted the sessions virtually
								because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We innovatived new formats to make the sessions engaging.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<h3>Understanding ecosystem</h3>
							<p>
								I interviewed other care teams to understand a complete ecosystem.
								Members' immediate care network often consisted of spouses 
								and adult children.
								<br/><br/>
								<strong>The conversational AI was situated in members' 
								immediate vicinity and formed a part of their primary 
								care network.</strong>

							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Care network.jpg" alt="Care network"/></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 0.8rem;">
								Conversational AI was part of the primary care network
							</h6>
							<br/>
							
							<hr>
							<h3>Research Insights</h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>Unreliable management practices:</strong> 
									Couples placed pillboxes near the daily routine objects, e.g stove, so they remember to take their medications. 
								</li>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Pillbox.jpg" alt="Picture of a pillbox"/></div>
								<br/>
								
								<li><strong>AI became a family member:</strong> 
									Members thought of voice AI as a real person. 
									They tried to have conversations with it as if its a family member.
								</li>
								<br/>

								<li><strong>Spouses acted as the gatekeepers:</strong> Spouses often felt burdened by the 
									responsibility of checking on their members about medications.
								</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								Can conversational AI relieve the care-partners from the responsibility 
								of checking on members about their medications?

				<!-- Design Goals -->
				<section class="container" id="Ch3">
					<div class="box">
						<h5>Chapter 3</h5>
						<h2>Design goals</h2>
						<p>
							I formulated the design goals based on the research.
						</p>
						<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Clock icon.png" alt="Clock icon" /></span>
							<h3>Fit seamlessly into existing routine</h3>
							The AI intervention shouldn't compel the elderly couple to form new habits. 
							It should fit seamlessly into their routine. <br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Minus icon.png" alt="Minus icon" /></span>
							<h3> Mitigate the risk of double dosing</h3>The AI system should 
							prompt reflection rather than being a command or suggestion.<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Diverse.png" alt="Multiple scenarios icon" /></span>
							<h3>Accommodate diverse scenarios</h3>Design should be reliable, 
							contextually aware, and take into not just the highest probability 
							scenarios but also variations.<br/><br/>
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>


				<!-- Mapping probable scenarios -->
				<section class="container" id="Ch4">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Chapter 4</h5>
							<h2>Mapping user expectations</h2>
							<p>
								To map different daily scenarios I partnered with the UX 
								researcher to conduct a participatory design activity with 35 couples.
								We storyboarded AI as "Rosie-the-robot" and asked couples to help us write the story.
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Storyboard.jpg" alt="Activity picture"/>
								<h6 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 0.8rem">Participatory design to understand user expectations</h6>
							</p>
							<br/>
							
							<hr>
							<h3>Expectations From Conversational AI</h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>Persist reminder if busy:</strong> 
									Users mentioned they would want AI 
									to persistently check in with them instead of just triggering it once.<br/>
								</li>
								<br/>
								
								<li><strong>Multi-platform design:</strong> 
									Users also mentioned they want AI to remind them on their phone if they are not around 
									at the time of medications.<br/>
								</li>
								<br/>

								<li><strong>Adding delight on task completion:</strong>
									Users mentioned they would be delighted AI praises them if they already 
									took the medications before it reminded them.<br/>
								</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
					</div>				
				</section>


				<!-- Designing AI interactions -->
				<section class="container" id="Ch5">
					<div class="box">
						<h5>Chapter 5</h5>
						<h2>Designing AI interactions, my process</h2>
							<p>
								I started by mapping down different scenarios and their probabilities in a map. (image below)
							</p>
							
							<a data-fancybox="images" href="images/VoiceAI/Scenarios.jpg" data-caption="Complete scenario map">

							<br/>
							<br/>
							
							<hr/>
							<h3>Technical limitations that impacted design</h3>
							<p>Google Nest Hub is a protected hardware which 
								limited our ability to customize the device. 
								Some limitations that impacted design:
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Integration with third-party pillboxes not supported:</strong> 
										Ideally, the AI assistant is kicked into action only when a 
										user forgets to take pills. But since Google Nest 
										didn't support integrations with third-party pillboxes, it limited 
										our ability to make contextual reminders.<br/>
									</li>
									<br/>
									
									<li><strong>No presence sensing:</strong> 
										We wanted to control the volume of AI assistant based on presence.
										The closer someone is, the smaller the volume, the farther, the louder. 
										However, we could not do this due to a lack of 
										presence-sensing.<br/>
									</li>
									<br/>
	
									<li><strong>Ability to snooze:</strong> 
										We could only trigger the AI assistant by time. 
										Thus, it restricted our ability to add a "snooze" 
										feature to the design.<br/>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<a data-fancybox="images" href="images/VoiceAI/Limited.jpg" data-caption="We were only able to implement a subset of scenarios due to tech constraints">

							<h6 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 0.8rem;">Subset of scenarios that we implemented</h6>
							<br/>
							<br/>

							<p>
								As multi-modal AI design was still a novel technology, 
								I created methods to design a holistic voice 
								and visual experience.<br/><br/>
								To accommodate various scenarios, I created a response chart with 
								possible interactions. I also built a spreadsheet with 
								possible semantic variations for responses to train the ML model.

						<h2>Final Interaction Models</h2>
						
						<br/>
						<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Designing for safety</h4>
						<p> 
							I stuctured the prompt such that it was a check-in rather than a reminder.
							This was critical to avoid double dosing. 
							The Med companion's language avoided any direct suggestion.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Safety.jpg" alt="Illustration of safety" />
						<br/>
						<br/>
						
						<br/>
						<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Name personalization for trust</h4>
						<p> 
							Med Companion addressed each user by their name. 
							This provided necessary context so users can be more 
							receptive to the assistant when it addressed them.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Name.jpg" alt="Concept of Name personalization" />
						<br/>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Time personalization for seamless experience</h4>
						<p> 
							Med Companion could be adjusted based on each users medication schedule. 
							They could personalize it to match their medication timings thereby 
							allowing it to seamlessly fit into their schedule.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Time.jpg" alt="Skill triggered at different times for different people"/>

						<br/>
						
						<br/>
						<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Positive reinforcement to build sustainable habits</h4>
						<p> 
							Med Companion supported users to build sustainable habits. 
							It applauded them when they took their meds before the trigger, 
							and offered support if they forgot.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Motivation.jpg" alt="Applause by AI"/>
						<br/>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Designing for familiarity</h4>
						<p> 
							As Med Companion was a multi-modal skill, the visual 
							interface was designed with supporting visuals 
							and familiar chime to make it easily recognizable.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Familiar.jpg" alt="Same visual cue and chime"/>
						<br/>

						<h2>Test Results</h2>
							<p>
								After three weeks of deployment, I conducted semi-structured 
								interviews to understand the skill performance. Feedback was positive.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/VoiceAI/Quotes.jpg" alt="Quotes from the field"/>
							<br/>
							
							<hr/>
							<h3>Qualitative Feedback</h3>
							<p>
								<ul>

									<li><strong>Conversational AI kept users from missing medications:</strong> 
										During interviews, users recalled several instances where they took medications when AI reminded them.
										It was also reduced care-partners burden to a certain extent.<br/>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<br/>
							
							<hr/>
							<h3>Quantitative Feedback</h3>
							<p>
								I analyzed interaction logs and found that in 20% of the cases, 
								users had taken the medications after conversational AI 
								had reminded them.

					<div class="box">
						<h2>Impact✨</h2>
						<p>
							<strong>Med Companion was shipped millions of users</strong> with Google Nest Hub devices, 
							so they could customize their own AI assistant for medication management.
							It also <strong>won the Best Project Award</strong> at ASSETS Conference for Computing 2022.

				<!-- Learnings -->
				<section class="container" id="Ch8">
					<div class="box">
						<h5>Chapter 8</h5>
						<h2>Learnings from the experience</h2>
						<br/>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>MVP solution better than no solution:</strong> Even though we designed a holistic solution, we only shipped the minimum viable part due to deadlines. I was nervous as the solution was far from perfect, but to my surprise, even that added value to our users' lives. Prioritizing product features to maximize user value can help break down the ideal vision into achievable goals.</li><br/>
							<li><strong>Successful remote collaboration:</strong> Planning became increasingly important due to the lack of opportunities for small conversations. Planning ahead, work sessions on Miro, task trackers all became critical tools for remote alignment. Remote collaboration was new, but we sought ways to succeed.</li><br/>
							<li><strong>Tremendous possibilities of multi-modal AI:</strong> Multi-modal AI was a relatively new technology in 2020. However, even at that point, I could realize the immense possibilities with it. I wrote an article sharing my views about the future of AI at that time, predicting that this technology has the potential to percolate almost every sphere of our lives.</li>
