							<h2>The Buzzword</h2>
							<p>
								As enterprises aggressively focus on digitization, cloud-computing continues to drive innovation for organizations.<br/><br/>In fact cloud apps have become so pervasive that 90% of businesses have adopted “cloud-based” approach.

								The project started on a haphazard note. However, as we proceeded in the project it was important for us to figure-out a  strategy which worked for everyone.

							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Switching work location</h3>
							<p>
								For initial days, we opted to work at the client location. It made knowledge transfer much more efficient. Plus, it was important for us to work closely with the development team to understand technical constraints to produce feasible designs.

							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Lean UX to the rescue</h3>
							<p>
								Given the fast-paced nature of the project we decided to adopt lean UX to deliver designs in bi-weekly sprints. We chucked the entire platform into smaller modules & focussed on understanding in-detail only on one module at a time.

						<h3>Businesses store critical data in "systems of record", and...</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/FutureIT/Tracing the footprints.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>
							Businesses have come a long way from manual bookkeeping of business records to local storage in computer hard-drives. Today they store their critical business data (finance, HR, customer) in cloud platforms such as Salesforce, SAP, Mendix etc (called, Systems of record).
						</p>
						<hr/>
						<br/>
						<h3>These "systems" are (super-) hard for regular employees to use, so...</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/FutureIT/Uncovering insights.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>
							However, as much as these Systems of record are valued for their ability to generate reports and insight for the company’s management team, they still remain complicated for the workers who engage with the customers on a regular basis, and often require years of expertise.
						</p>
						<hr/>
						<br/>
						<h3>Businesses build custom workflow apps, which require IT support & money...</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/FutureIT/Identifying the need.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>
							Due to complexity of Systems of record, businesses often have to develop their own workflow applications which are poor in usability and incur high developmental costs and long maintenance and deployment cycles.
						</p>
						<hr/>
						<br/>
						<h3>Thus, they need a platform to build custom apps for employees (super-) fast</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/FutureIT/Recognising the opportunity.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>
							There is a dire need of a platform which integrates itself with different Systems of record, helps businesses to create custom workflow apps rapidly and provides a seamless experience to company workers to engage with the customers effectively.
