							I worked on this project for a duration of 10 months. I collaborated with 2 project managers, engineering team, 2 visual designers, and customer success at the client side to deliver hi-fi mockups, wireframes & prototypes.<br/><br/>

								<li>Bottom navigation is best way to represent fixed sections as it is always visible and universally accessible.</li>

							<h2>What I learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Empathize with users, but also with stakeholders:</strong> Initially as a designer, I thought my job is only to empathize with the users. However, I quickly learnt that it is equally important to empathize with the stakeholders, because in a company there are many practical contraints like resources, finance, timelines that need to managed in order to implement a design. Hence, understanding those constraints helped me create designs which balance user as well as stakeholder needs.</li><br/>
								<li><strong>Take as much early feedback as possible:</strong> During my initial days as a designer, I shied away from feedback due to fear of being judged. But working on Turbo Systems I realise how critical it is to take early feedback, not just from users but also from fellow designers, developers, marketing folks etc. Everyone analyses design from a different prespective which exposes me to completely new way of seeing my design.</li><br/>
								<li><strong>Learn from diverse teams:</strong> As a designer, I was often the centerpiece of collaboration. Having a software development background helped me immensly in collaborating efficiently with the engineering team, but I understood expanding my knowledge in adjacent domains was as critical. While working with the diverse teams, I learnt a lot about different domains, for e.g. marketing, product management, sales etc which made me a far effective designer.

							<h5>Figuring out the logistics</h5>
							<h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
							<p>
								The project started on a haphazard note. However, as we proceeded in the project it was important for us to figure-out a  strategy which worked for everyone.
							</p>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Switching work location</h3>
							<p>
								For initial days, we opted to work at the client location. It made knowledge transfer much more efficient. Plus, it was important for us to work closely with the development team to understand technical constraints to produce feasible designs.
							</p>

							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Lean UX to the rescue</h3>
							<p>
								Given the fast-paced nature of the project we decided to adopt lean UX to deliver designs in bi-weekly sprints. We chucked the entire platform into smaller modules & focussed on understanding in-detail only on one module at a time.
