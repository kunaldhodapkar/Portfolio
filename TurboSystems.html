				<!-- Expression Builder -->
				<section class="container">

								App admins need to configure business logic into workflows. This is core to any enterprise app. However, these expressions can sometimes be quite complicated.

							<br/>
							<blockquote>How do we enable IT admins to create complex business logic in a simple, efficient and intuitive way, without having them to code?</blockquote>
							<hr>
							<br/>
							<h3>Goals for the Expression Builder</h3>
							<p>
								I started by drafting high-level goals for this module. This was critical to ensure my designs accomplished their purpose and remained useful to the users.<br/><br/>
								<strong>1. Efficient:</strong> Create complex conditions quickly, with ease, and with least effort.<br/>
								<strong>2. Intuitive:</strong> Interactions should be evident, have minimum learning curve.<br/>
								3. <strong>Clean:</strong> Layout should make the expression visually easy to grasp.<br/>
							</p>

							<br/>
							<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>

							</div>
							<hr>
							<br/>
							<h3>Early Prototype</h3>
							<p>
								Based on the research and requirements, I create a low-fi prototype to get early feedback from internal users, and senior designers in the studio.
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit">
							<a data-fancybox="images" href="images/TurboSystems/Expression Builder v1.jpg" data-caption="Low-fi wireframes for getting early feedback">

							<strong>I found, the triad structure worked well, but box inside box didn't have sufficient contrast and couldn't be scaled to multiple nested levels.</strong>
							</div>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Iterate and Refine</h3>
							<p>
								I iterated multiple times to discover limitations, new users requirements. With every iteration, I increased fidelity of my designs.<br/>
							</p>
							<div class="image fit">
							<a data-fancybox="images" href="images/TurboSystems/Iterations.jpg" data-caption="Low-fi wireframes for getting early feedback">

							<strong>I discovered that distinct colors for field, operator & value improved readability and indents were helpful in differentiating nested conditions.</strong>
							</div>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Deeper than Interface</h3>
							<p>
								I noticed that competitor products used all operators for each field. Users had to figure out relevant operators themselves. This increased selection times and chances of error.<br/><br/>
							
							<strong>Having a comprehensive list of operators and their relevant operands, <hl>increased efficiency, reduced chances of error and improved overall experience.</hl></strong>
							</p>
							<a data-fancybox="images" href="images/TurboSystems/Table.jpg" data-caption="Table of operators">

							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Logic Breakdown.jpg" alt="Logic Breakdown" /></div>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
							<p>
								I conducted usability testing with a clickthrough prototype with the internal users to discover usability issues in the designs.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit">
							<a data-fancybox="images" href="images/TurboSystems/Prototype Eval.jpg" data-caption="Hi-fi prototype for final evaluation">
								<img src="images/TurboSystems/Prototype Eval.jpg" alt="Prototype" />

							<h4>Issues discovered</h4>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Cluttered view:</strong> With nested conditions the view became cluttered easily.</li>
								<li><strong>Re-create conditions:</strong> Cumbersome to create same conditions multiple times.</li>
								<li><strong>Rigid structure:</strong> Stucture did not allow them to make customizations easily.
							</ul>
							<hr>
							<br/>
							<h3>Final Designs</h3>
							<br/>
							<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Triad Structure for Simplicity</h4>
							<p> 
								Field, operator, value structure is used across many products, is simple to understand, intuitive and requires no learning curve.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Triad.jpg" alt="Triad structure" />
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Color Coding for Visual Clarity</h4>

								Distinct colors for field, operator and value help to add visual segregation between elements and improve readability.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Color Coding.jpg" alt="Color coding the elements" />
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Grouping and Hover for Efficiency</h4>
							<p> 
								Having a ability to visually abstract the conditions under group will reduce visual clutter and hover to move will help to create complex expressions with ease.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Grouping and Hover.jpg" alt="Grouping and hover interaction"/>
							<br/>
							<br/>

							<h3>Final Evaluation</h3>
							<p>
								I conducted usability testing with a prototype with 3 internal users by giving benchmark tasks. Main findings from the evaluation:
								<ol>
								<li><strong>Intuitive Interactions:</strong> Users were able to figure out functions of various elements within the interface.<br/></li>
								<li><strong>Visually Clear:</strong> Users understood the expression, the structure and the interactions.<br/></li>
								<li><strong>Enhancing Efficiency:</strong> They expressed suggestion to duplicate expressions for making the workflow more efficient.<br/></li>

				<!-- What I learned -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h2>What I learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Empathize with users, but also with stakeholders:</strong> Initially as a designer, I only empathized with the users. However, I learnt that it is equally important to empathize with the stakeholders as well, because in a company there are many practical contraints of resources, finance to implement a design. This helped me create designs which balance user as well as stakeholder needs.</li><br/>
								<li><strong>Take as much early feedback as possible:</strong> During my initial days, I shied away from feedback due to fear of being judged. But I realised how critical it is to take early feedback, not just from users but also from fellow designers, developers, product owners. Everyone analyses design from a different prespective which exposes me to completely new way of seeing my designs.</li><br/>
								<li><strong>Learn from diverse teams:</strong> I was often the centerpiece of collaboration. I realized the importance of expanding my knowledge in adjacent domains. While working with the diverse teams, I learnt about marketing, product management, sales etc which made me a far effective designer.

							<strong>Pain-points for enterprises</strong>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Cost icon.png" alt="Cost icon" /></span>
								<h3>Massive IT infrastructural cost</h3>Large enterprises host a dedicated IT team to build apps. Small, medium sized businesses often end up using spreadsheets.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Clock icon.png" alt="Clock icon" /></span>
								<h3>Tediously long development cycles</h3>Enterprise apps are developed by external vendor or internal IT team. Development cycles are long and tedious.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Lock icon.png" alt="Lock icon" /></span>
								<h3>Locked in CRM systems</h3>Data silos of enterprises fill up pretty quickly. Data migrations across CRM systems are often too risky or impossible.<br/><br/>

							<blockquote>All this means, the enterprises end up losing money and employees their productivity.</blockquote>

							<h5>Figuring out the logistics</h5>
							<h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
							<p>
								The project started on a haphazard note. However, as we proceeded in the project it was important for us to figure-out a  strategy which worked for everyone.
							</p>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Switching work location</h3>
							<p>
								For initial days, we opted to work at the client location. It made knowledge transfer much more efficient. Plus, it was important for us to work closely with the development team to understand technical constraints to produce feasible designs.
							</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Work Location.png" alt="Changing work location" /></span>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Lean UX to the rescue</h3>
							<p>
								Given the fast-paced nature of the project we decided to adopt lean UX to deliver designs in bi-weekly sprints. We chucked the entire platform into smaller modules & focussed on understanding in-detail only on one module at a time.
