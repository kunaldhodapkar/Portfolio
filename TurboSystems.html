							<h2>Journey of transformation</h2>
							<p>
								When Turbo Systems came to us, they were reluctant to have any kind of UX process for their product. But as of today, I’m happy to report that they host an in-house design team in their company.<br/><br/>This is a story of how our work brought about this transformation in Turbo.

					<div class="box">
							<h5>How it started</h5>
							<h2>Thrown into disarray</h2>
							<p>
								The project started on a haphazard note. Things were not streamlined and we faced multiple logistical challenges...
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Question icon.png" alt="Question icon" /></span>
								<h3>No UX process in place</h3>Initially clients expected us to deliver beautified individual screens. They were reluctant to spend time in any UX activities.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Code icon.png" alt="Code icon" /></span>
								<h3>Several technical constraints</h3>Turbo was built on top of existing enterprise database systems. Thus, there were some critical technical constraints to consider.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Sandglass icon.png" alt="Sandglass icon" /></span>
								<h3>Tight delivery deadlines</h3>Dev team was fully setup at the client side. This made delivery timelines extremely short as idle resources costed money.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<blockquote>Being a start-up and dev team dependent on our designs, we had to dive into mockups almost immediately...</blockquote>

				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Acting according to the situation</h5>
							<h2>Embracing uncertainity</h2>
							<p>
								Understanding the criticality of the situation we decided to start with mockups. However, we also understood that to do justice to this project we had to <strong>figure-out UX strategy which worked for everyone.</strong>
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Mockups.jpg" alt="Image: Mockups"/>
					</div>

				<!-- My Role -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box special">
						<h2>My Role</h2>
						<p> 
							I worked on this project with 2 other UI designers for a duration of 10 months. My background in software development helped me understand end-to-end architechture and deliver designs with ready-to-go market attributes.<br/><br/>
							In addition, I worked alongside PMs, QA, Management & Dev team at the client side to deliver mockups, wireframes & prototypes.<br/><br/><strong>The platform was launched globally on January 5th 2019.</strong>

				<!-- Circling back to the user -->

					<div class="box">
							<h5>Strategy 1</h5>
							<h2>Circling back to the user</h2>
							<p>While working on individual screens and mockups, we conducted KT meetings with the product owner to understand the users of this platform and their motivations behind.
							<br/><br/>We created 2 distinct personas of this platform. We ensured our future designs actually catered to them.
							<blockquote>Creating our designs around users helped Turbo team understand the user-centered approach...</blockquote>

				<!-- Establishing a process -->

							<h2>Establishing a process</h2>
							<p>
								Given the fast-paced nature of the project we decided to adopt <strong>lean UX</strong> to deliver designs in bi-weekly sprints.

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Lean UX.jpg" alt="Lean UX Process" /></div>

							<h5>Strategy 3</h5>
							<h2>Involving developers in the process</h2>
							<p>
								We switched our work location from Lollypop design studio to the Turbo Systems. We worked on alongside developers involving them in the design process. We used whiteboards as our collaboration tool to get quick feedback.
							</p>

				<!-- The Design System -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Strategy 4</h5>
							<h2>Pioneering a design system</h2>
							<p>
								Design System was a trending term those days. It was never tried out before in any project in our studio, so it was an experimental effort for us. I along with UI designers crafted the first design system for Turbo.

							<h5>When 24 hours are not enough</h5>
							<h2>Reaching a deadlock</h2>
							<p>
								4 months into the project and we were working round the clock. Due to complex nature of this platform, we were still lagging behind the schedule.<br/><br/>
								<strong>With just one month remaining in the launch, we were in a deadlock situation.</strong>
							</p>
					</div>				
				</section>


				<!-- The War Room -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Strategy 5</h5>
							<h2>The War Room</h2>
							<p>
								To overcome the deadlock, we had to expedite the communication and decision making at every level.<br/><br/>Thus, we brought HODs of engineering, marketing, sales and management in a single room for 2 weeks and involved them in the design process.<br/><strong> We called it: Turbo War Room.</strong>
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/War room.jpg" alt="War room pics"/></div>
							<blockquote>We were able to complete 5 major features of the platform in 10 days which led to on-time release of the product.</blockquote>

							<h5>For App Administrators</h5>
							<h2>Turbo Studio</h2>
							<p>
								Turbo Studio is a cloud platform for app administrators to build or modify enterprise apps at a lightning speed.
							</p>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>App Administrator</h3>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/App admin.jpg" alt="App admin persona" /></div>

							<h6 style="text-align: center;">Checklist concept design in collaboration with Dhilip Ganeshan</h6>
							<br/>
							<p>
								 Turbo creates custom elements based on the database architecture.<br/><br/>
								<strong>We developed a simple drag and drop architecture, so the app admins don't have to write code or create an interface. They just drag the elements they need to create workflows, checklists, maps and more..</strong>

				<!-- Expression Builder -->
				<section class="container">

							<h5>Simplifying logic configuration</h5>

								App admins configure business logic, which is core to an enterprise app.
							</p>
							<blockquote>Admins don’t code. How do we enable them to create complex business logic in a seamless and intuitive way?</blockquote>
							<hr>
							<br/>
							<h3>Extracting the logical components</h3>
							<p>
								I collaborated with the developers to list different types of operators and operands. I implemented Behavioral Driven Development approach for the logical structure, so it is traslated into a phrase from everyday language.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Table.png" alt="Table" />

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Logic Breakdown.jpg" alt="Logic Breakdown" /></div>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Version 1</h3>
							<p>
								I adopted rapid prototyping approach. This module was central to the entire platform, the idea was to test and get as much feedback from the users as possible.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Expression Builder v1.jpg" alt="Expression Builder WFs" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">Early prototype screens for expression builder</h6>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Usability testing with the QA Team</h3>
							<p>
								I conducted usability sessions with QA team at the client location as their profile matched to the app admins. These helped us discover some usability issues early in the process.
							</p>
							<h4>Issues discovered</h4>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>No clarity for nested conditions:</strong> They found it hard to distinguish conditions when number of levels increased above 3.</li>
								<li><strong>Re-create same conditions:</strong> Users found it cumbersome to create same conditions multiple times.</li>
								<li><strong>Rigid structure:</strong> Users followed different approaches to create expressions, they found the stucture did not allow them to make customizations on the go. 
							</ul>
							<hr>
							<br/>
							<h3>Version 5</h3>
							<p>
								We conducted multiple rounds of testing, with every version being a little better than the previous one. Finally we settled with v5 for the launch.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Color coding for visual clarity</h4>
							<p> 
								We color coded elements to make them visually distinct.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Color Coding.jpg" alt="Color coding the elements" />
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Grouping conditions for abstraction</h4>
							<p> 
								Users can <i>group</i> multiple conditions. This enabled them to nest and form of much more complex expressions with ease.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Grouping.jpg" alt="Grouping the conditions" />
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<h4 style="line-height: 0.5rem">Move around for flexible structure</h4>
							<p> 
								Users can move a condition or entire group around. This enabled them to create logical expression in whichever order they found comfortable.

							<h5>For App Users</h5>
							<h2>Turbo Roadster</h2>

							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>On-field Employees</h3>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/App user.jpg" alt="App user persona" /></div>
							<blockquote>In short, we were not designing for ‘the’ user. Their profiles and tasks vary greatly. We followed universal design principles as we were designing for the world...</blockquote>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Structure for infinite permutations</h3>
							<p>
								In Studio, admin can practically create infinite combinations of components. Thus, we created a universal stucture which could handle those permutations.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/IA Roadster.jpg" alt="IA Roadster App" /></div>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Navigational components</h3>
							<p>
								These were critical part of the app. They accomodated scalable and fixed sections depending on the admin’s configuration.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/TurboSystems/Navigation Components.jpg" alt="Navigation Components" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">I chose bottom navigation for fixed sections and vertical side panel for custom sections to keep it scalable.</h6>
							<hr/>
							<br/>
							<h3>Prototype, Prototype, Prototype</h3>
							<p>
								Having a seamless navigation strcture was core to this app. Thus, I ended up creating multiple prototypes for navigation.

							<h3>Getting Expert Feedback</h3>

							<p>
								<blockquote>As I created a novel interaction for the side panel, I decided to get feedback from the senior UX designers in our design studio.</blockquote> Based on their feedback, I decided to discontinue with the approach as it involved a significant learning curve– not very good for low tech-savvy people.
							</p>
							<!-- <h4>Action Points</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Bottom navigation is best way to represent fixed sections as it is always visible and universally accessible.</li>
								<li>Scalable sections are best represented in the vertical panel to allow future additions.</li>
								<li>Keeping search universally accessible is critical for the app.</li>
