										In 2012, the world was undergoing an amazing transformation. Usability was taking the centre stage in product design. The businesses were focussing on great user experience, not only for their customers but also for their workers. <br/><br/>  I was a part of an ambitious project to create a powerful cloud platform that enabled businesses to deploy highly customised workflow applications rapidly, without writing a single line of code.

						<h2>Understanding the Landscape</h2>
						<h3>Tracing the footprints</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/FutureIT/Tracing the footprints.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>
							Businesses have come a long way from manual bookkeeping of business records to local storage in computer hard-drives. Today they store their critical business data (finance, HR, customer) in cloud platforms such as Salesforce, SAP, Mendix etc (called, Systems of record).
						</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Uncovering insights</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/FutureIT/Uncovering insights.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>
							However, as much as these Systems of record are valued for their ability to generate reports and insight for the company’s management team, they still remain complicated for the workers who engage with the customers on a regular basis, and often require years of expertise.
						</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Identifying the need</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/FutureIT/Identifying the need.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>
							Due to complexity of Systems of record, businesses often have to develop their own workflow applications which are poor in usability and incur high developmental costs and long maintenance and deployment cycles.
						</p>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Recognising the opportunity</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/FutureIT/Recognising the opportunity.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>
							There is a dire need of a platform which integrates itself with different Systems of record, helps businesses to create workflow apps rapidly and provides a seamless experience to company workers to engage with the customers effectively.
						</p>

								<h4>
									I worked with a team of 3 designers to design the entire platform and single handedly managed a major segment that dealt with workers. <br/><br/> Due to pre-schdeuled launch, our team was in extreme pressure to deliver fast. So, we opted for a lean approach which emphasised rapid sketching, prototyping, feedback and design mockups. We worked in one week sprints to deliver our designs.
									<br/><br/> 
									<div style="border-top: solid 2px #e5e5e5; padding-top: 1em">
										My previous experience in software development was immensely helpful in understanding the underlying architecture of Systems of record and coming up with meaningful design features which adhered to the development deadlines and added value to the product.

									They are the users of these workflow applications. They interact with customers and internal stakeholders on a daily basis. They require these apps to be high in usability and rely on them to get their job done.

						</div>

						<h3>Usability for everyone, everywhere</h3>
						<p>								
							Businesses range from aviation to manufacturing to banking, with each having different job profiles and processes. The challenge here was to create a design, which was flexible enough to accommodate needs of various businesses and usable enough for wide-range of people.<br/><br/>This project required a in-depth research of different profiles, however, due to strict timelines and launch deadline, after discussion with the client, we started with research about field service industry, as it contained a substantial customer base.
