									Students are increasingly preferring to use digital textbooks instead of carrying a physical one. But when we think of digital books, a static PDF does but a little to make complete use of functions digital platforms have to offer.<br/><br/> This project was an innovative attempt to transform a 1000 page PDF textbook into an interactive experience for students.

				<section class="container">

							<h2>Discovering the problem space</h2>
							<p>
								At the end of each semester Georgia Tech conducts a survey for every course to know about students’ learning experience. One such survey received a whopping– 300+ responses and revealed a pervasive problem space.<blockquote> The survey revealed, students found it hard and unengaging to use the long PDF textbooks provided for the course...</blockquote>

				<!-- My Role -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box special">
						<h2>My Role</h2>
						<p> 
						This project was a collaboration effort between Center of Teaching and Learning and Department of Economics. I worked on this project as a UX designer for a duration of 4 months.<br/><br/>I was involved after the survey was conducted. I worked alongside content writer and a product owner.<br/><br/><strong>The goal of this project was to create an interactive textbook for students which will enhance their learning experience.</strong>
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>



				<!-- Process -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
						<h2>Process</h2>
						<p>
							I started the project with analysing the survey responses and extracting pain-points of students. Furthermore, I conducted in-person interviews with the students taking the course to guide my first prototype. Later, I got feedback from course instructor and students to iterate and deploy the final version.

							<h5>How I got there</h5>
							<h2>Excavating pain points</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Survey</h3>
							<p>
								To begin this project, I dived into analyzing the survey responses. The survey asked a range of questions about the course. This survey received 300+ responses.  
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/InteractiveTextbook/PDF icon.png" alt="PDF icon" style="width:100px"/></span>
							<h3>Majority students prefer PDF textbook</h3>80% of the students preferred to read digital PDF textbook over physical one.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/InteractiveTextbook/PDF nav icon.png" alt="PDF nav icon" style="width:100px"/></span>
							<h3>PDF hard to navigate</h3>Students found it very hard to jump between or to find a specific topic. Also, PDFs don't work well on smaller form-factors.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/InteractiveTextbook/Book icon.png" alt="Book icon" style="width:100px"/></span>
							<h3>Book too verbose</h3>Many students also expressed their discontent with amount of words. They found it tiring to read.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Interviews</h3>
							<p>
								I also conducted a couple of informal interviews with the students taking the course to find out more.
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/InteractiveTextbook/Quiz icon.png" alt="Quiz icon" style="width:100px"/></span>
							<h3>Summary useful for quizzes</h3>Students found the summary for every topic very useful and used it in revising for weekly quizzes.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/InteractiveTextbook/Question icon.png" alt="Question icon" style="width:100px"/></span>
							<h3>No way of checking understanding</h3>Students couldn’t check their understanding of concepts after they finished a topic.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/InteractiveTextbook/Reward icon.png" alt="Reward icon" style="width:100px"/></span>
							<h3>No reward system</h3>Students who spent hours reading the book. But felt that their efforts were not worth as there was no reward system.<br/><br/>

				<!-- Rapid Prototype -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
						<h2>Rapid Prototype</h2>
						<p>
							Based on the insights from the surveys and interviews, I worked on creating the prototype for the first chapter of the textbook.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/InteractiveTextbook/Rapid Prototype.jpg" alt="Images: Prototyping" /></div>
					</div>				
				</section>


				<!-- Feedback -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h2>Feedback and Evaluation</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Feedback from instructor</h3>
							<p>
								I shared the prototype with the course instructor to get her feedback. I was able to refine my prototype based on her feedback. 
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Inclusion of videos in summary:</strong> Videos help to better understand the topic, thus we decided to include videos in the summary section.</li>
								<li><strong>Creating knowledge check for every topic:</strong> I suggested inclusion of knowledge check questions for every topic. This will help students to check their understanding of the concepts.</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Evalution with students</h3>
							<p>
								The new interactive textbook received a high SUS score of 85.3. Based on the prototype, I worked on creating the content and UI structure for the remaining chapters in the textbook.
							</p>
							<blockquote>It's great, I love it! If I had this book this semester, I would have definitely used it!</blockquote><h6 style="text-align: center;">GTech student who took course in Fall 19</h6>

				<!-- The Final Design -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h2>The Final Design</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Seamless navigation between topics</h3>
							<p>
								Students can search and navigate seamlessly between topics which is a daunting task in a static PDF version of the textbook.
							</p>
							<div class="image featured"><img src="images/InteractiveTextbook/Navigation.jpg" alt="Navigation screen"/>
							</div>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Summary with video content</h3>
							<p>
								Students want a quick way to revise topics before quizzes. What better way to get a brief summary of every topic along with a video which explains it nicely!
							</p>
							<div class="image featured"><img src="images/InteractiveTextbook/Summary.jpg" alt="Summary" />
							</div>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Quick knowledge checks</h3>
							<p>
								Students often want to check their understanding of the concepts. How about quick knowldge checks which help you assess which topics you understand and which ones you have to work on.
							</p>
							<div class="image featured"><img src="images/InteractiveTextbook/Knowledge Check.jpg" alt="Knowledge checks" />
							</div>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Responsive design</h3>
							<p>
								The book content adjusts beautifully in all form-factors. Thus, students can have great reading experience on whichever device they use the most.

				<!-- What'S Next -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
						<h5>Coming next...</h5>
						<h2>Deployment</h2>
						<p>
							Post evaluation, I worked on the developing the textbook for the remaining chapters. This interactive textbook will be deployed to students in Fall 2020.<br/><br/>I hope it solves their major pain-points and providing them with an enhanced learning experience.
