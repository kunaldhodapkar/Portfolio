									In 2019, Nutanix (B2B cloud computing firm) made a massive shift from traditional term-based contract pricing to subscription-based pricing. Their customer acquisition strategy changed from cold-calling customers to offering self-serving product trials.<br/><br/>I was tasked with the critical responsiblity of reimagining their trial experience, from scratch.

						<h2>Designing for Growth</h2>
						<p>
							With enterprises shifting to cloud, just in 3 years market size doubled to <strong>$24B</strong>. It is humanly impossible to scale sales reps at such a rapid pace.<br/><br/>Nutanix suffered from a similar problem where it was finding it hard to keep-up sales with the hyper-growth of the market.
							<blockquote>Nutanix needed a way to provide zero-touch purchase experience so customers can buy their product even without a sales intervention...</blockquote>

				<!-- The Challenge -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
						<h2>The Challenge</h2>
						<p> 
							In enterprise space, free trials can be the quickest way to show the value proposition to a potential customer. However, the products tend to be inherently complex, feature rich and often optimized for power use.<br/><br/> How do we design a trial experience for someone using the product for the first time?<br/><br/><strong>My high-level goals were to:</strong><br/>
							1. Help new users understand the product.<br/>
							2. Show value proposition of the platform quickly.<br/>
							3. Provide support to help them make a purchase decision.<br/>

					<div class="box special">
						<h2>My Role</h2>
						<p> 
							I was the sole UX designer working on this project with a senior designer as my mentor. I collaborated with UX researcher, 2 PMs, Engineering team, Solution Architect to design the end-to-end trial experience.<br/><br/><strong> I also drove convergence of various teams around MVP trial experience to be shipped for the product launch.</strong>

				<!-- What already exists -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Phase 1</h5>
							<h2>Starting with what exists</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Existing trial experience</h3>
							<p>
								To understand what worked in existing trial, I conducted <strong>usability tests with 3 participants.</strong> I discovered major usability issues in the current experience.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Xi IoT Journey.jpg" alt="Xi Iot User Journey" /></div><br/>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							Users explored product randomly because there was no guidance. And important options like help were buried deep in navigation.
							</p><br/><br/>
							<div class="image fit" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #ebebeb; border-width: thin;"><img src="images/Nutanix/Xi IoT Trial.gif" alt="Xi IoT trial demo" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">Users closed "quick start" as soon as they landed on dashboard because it interrupted their workflow</h6><br/>
							<blockquote>I learnt that current trial experience wasn't working. It had to be redesigned from the ground up...</blockquote>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>Benchmarked direct and indirect competitors</strong> across sign-up, in-product trial and purchase phase against the existing trial experience.
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Competitor Benchmarking.jpg" alt="Competitor Analysis" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">Openshift didn't require sign-up for trial while Platform9 had in-product help easily accessible</h6><br/><br/>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							Openshift used tutorial with sample content to onboard users. Successsful deployment prompted users to explore product further.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<blockquote>Tutorials focus on learning by doing. They can be a great way to help users learn more about the product.</blockquote>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Digging into data</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>Analysed last year's data</strong> to gather more insights into user behaviors in a trial.
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Trial Data.jpg" alt="Image: Data analytics of Trial" /></div><br/>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							 On an average, users spent less than 11 minutes in a trial after they first logged in.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<blockquote>With such a limited time, how do we show users the value of the product in the first 10 minutes of the trial?</blockquote>
					</div>			
				</section>



				<!-- User Research -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Phase 2</h5>
							<h2>User Research</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Interviews</h3>
							<p>
								To probe deeper into what customers look for in a trial, I collaborated with a UX researcher and <strong>interviewed 7 potential customers across 6 continents.</strong>
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/User demographics.jpg" alt="Customer locations" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">I interviewed customers across 6 continents to understand their needs during a product trial</h6><br/>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>User Personas</h3>
							<p>
								Based on interviews I developed 2 personas to highlight the trends in data.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Persona1.jpg" alt="Persona of Sole Champion" /></div>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							In small orgs, users look for feature-set rather than UI. Their job responsiblities overlap. To learn more, they prefer documentation.<br/><br/>

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Persona2.jpg" alt="Persona of team facilitator" /></div>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							In organization with large teams, users look for simple UI so they donâ€™t spend time training employees who administer the platform.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Buyer Journey</h3>
							<p>
								I mapped typical actions customers take in their buying journey from the interviews.
							</p>
							<div class="image featured"><img src="images/Nutanix/Buyer Journey.jpg" alt="Images: Buyer actions" /></div>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							 Users collaborate with colleagues to evaluate a product. Require buy-in from multiple teams. Often have other priority items on list.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<blockquote>Users are collaborate to evaluate a platform, they are distracted, they don't have much time, how do I optimise trial for these constraints?</blockquote>
					</div>			
				</section>




				<!-- Divergence -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Phase 3</h5>
							<h2>Divergence and Evaluation</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Onboarding</h3>
							<p>
								The goal for onboarding was to provide users meaningful context to help them get started as fast as possible.<br/><br/>
								I considered various options:<br/>
								â€¢ Using user info like company or role upfront to customize the onboarding?<br/>
								â€¢ Having a video shown up upfront or onboarding screens?<br/>
								â€¢ Giving them 3 tutorials or providing them catalogue of tutorials?<br/>
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Onboarding options.jpg" alt="Onboarding options" /></div><br/>
							<ul>
								<li>I decided to ask role information as it was adequate to customize userâ€™s experience in a meaningful way.</li>
								<li>Not showing video upfront, because it would delay users in getting started with the product. Instead, I used onboarding screens to provide context.</li>
								<li>Highlighting important workflows because not finding a business use-case would risk user dropping-out  early in the onboarding.</li>
								<li>Giving a catalogue of tutorials would overwhelm users and force them to choose between large number of options, which might delay them from getting started with the product.</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>In-product guidance</h3>
							<p>
								For in-product guidance the goal was to help users understand the product without hampering their exploration workflow.<br/><br/>
								â€¢ I considered having short tutorials.<br/>
								â€¢ Showing them a progress card on dashboard with main actions like LinkedIn. <br/>
								â€¢ Using a popup to introduce a section.<br/>
								â€¢ Just opening up a new tab with documentation.<br/>
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Guidance options.jpg" alt="Guidance options" /></div><br/>
							<ul>
								<li>I decided to <strong>use tutorials as a way to educate customers</strong> about the product because I discovered that sales team used the same approach in workshops to teach new customers about a product which was very effective.</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<div class="image fit" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #ebebeb; border-width: thin;"><img src="images/Nutanix/Tutorial options.jpg" alt="Tutorial options" /></div><br/>
							<ul>
								<li>I zeroed-in on two options, a floating panel which shows them tutorial instructions and a WalkMe bubble that walks them by through the instructions. I figured that both approaches accomplish the required goals. And so, <strong>I was stuck.</strong></li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Evaluation</h3>
							<p>
								To resolve the conflict, I prototyped a sample tutorial in both the approaches and conducted a <strong>within-subjects study with 7 users.</strong>
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/User feedback.jpg" alt="Image: User feedback" /></div><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Feedback graph.jpg" alt="Feedback graph" /></div>
							<blockquote>Participants found Panel approach more helpful because of it's flexiblity and ability to provide over-arching context...</blockquote>

							<h5>Phase 4</h5>
							<h2>Final Designs</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Personalize and Onboard</h3>
							<p>
								Know the user coming to the platform, understand their goals and <strong>personalize onboarding</strong>, so they see what's relevant to them right from the start.

				<!-- Learnings -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h2>What I learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>It starts out fuzzy, but keep at it and focus on the process:</strong> I was flustered initially because the problem space was technically challenging. However, as I started breaking down the problem, collect data, meeting PMs and leaders in the team to understand the business context, clarity started to emerge. One of the things that helped me throughout the internship was to stay laser-focussed on the user. Trying to understand their needs, pain-points, motivations helped me add tremendous value to the project.</li><br/>
								<li><strong>Get into field, validate assumptions:</strong> When I started out with the project, there were many unknowns. And to be able to make informed decisions, it is important to get into the field and speak with real people. I was skeptical about my decision to conduct user study initially, because of the tight internship timeline. However in retrospect, it was probably the best decision that added immense value to the quantitative data and defined future direction of the project.</li><br/>
								<li><strong>Involve stakeholders in the process:</strong> When I joined Nutanix, the product was being still being built. Over the course of my internship the business needs kept evolving as new factors of cost, feature, timeline came into consideration. One of the things that helped me to stay updated with the latest business decisions was to share my progress and findings with the stakeholders regularly. This not only helped me to figure where my findings make most sense but also create designs that accommodated evolving business needs.
