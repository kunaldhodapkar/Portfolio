									In 2019, Nutanix (B2B cloud computing firm) made a massive shift from traditional term-based contract pricing to subscription-based pricing. Their customer acquisition strategy changed from cold-calling customers to offering self-serving product trials.<br/><br/>I was tasked with the critical responsiblity of reimagining their trial experience, from scratch.

						<h2>Designing for Growth</h2>
						<p>
							With enterprises shifting to cloud, just in 3 years market size doubled to <strong>$24B</strong>. It is humanly impossible to scale sales reps at such a rapid pace.<br/><br/>Nutanix suffered from a similar problem where it was finding it hard to keep-up sales with the hyper-growth of the market.
							<blockquote>Nutanix needed a way to provide zero-touch purchase experience so customers can buy their product even without a sales intervention...</blockquote>

				<!-- Breaking down problem -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
						<h2>Breaking down problem</h2>
						<p>
							Designing a complete trial experience has wide scope, right from when user signs-up until he buys a subscription. To design a meaningful experience I broke it down into 3 segments. I met with product & executive leaders to understand team’s priorities and set expectations.<br/><br/><hl>We decided that focussing on the in-product experience during a trial is of critical importance for the product launch.</hl>

				<!-- What already exists -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Phase 1</h5>
							<h2>Starting with what exists</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Existing trial experience</h3>
							<p>
								To understand what worked in existing trial, I conducted <strong>usability tests with 3 participants.</strong> I discovered major usability issues in the current experience.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Xi IoT Journey.jpg" alt="Xi Iot User Journey" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">Existing trial user journey</h6><br/><br/>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							Users explored product randomly because there was no guidance. And important options like help were buried deep in navigation.
							</p><br/>
							<!-- <div class="image fit" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #ebebeb; border-width: thin;"><img src="images/Nutanix/Xi IoT Trial.gif" alt="Xi IoT trial demo" /></div> 
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">Users closed "quick start" as soon as they landed on dashboard because it interrupted their workflow</h6><br/> -->
							<!-- <blockquote>I learnt that current trial experience wasn't working. It had to be redesigned from the ground up...</blockquote> -->
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>Benchmarked direct and indirect competitors</strong> across sign-up, in-product trial and purchase phase against the existing trial experience.
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Competitor Benchmarking.jpg" alt="Competitor Analysis" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">Openshift didn't require sign-up for trial while Platform9 had in-product help easily accessible</h6><br/><br/>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							Openshift used tutorial with sample content to onboard users. Successsful deployment prompted users to explore product further.</p>
							<!-- <blockquote>Tutorials focus on learning by doing. They can be a great way to help users learn more about the product.</blockquote> -->
							
							<ul class="actions special small">
								<li><a href="images/Nutanix/Competitor Analysis.pdf" target="_blank" class="button alt small">See detailed analysis</a></li>
							</ul>

							<br/>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Digging into data</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>Analysed last year's data</strong> to gather more insights into user behaviors in a trial.
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Trial Data.jpg" alt="Image: Data analytics of Trial" /></div><br/>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							 On an average, users spent less than 11 minutes in a trial after they first logged in.
							</p><br/>
							<blockquote>In such a limited time, how do we show users the value of the product in the first 10 minutes of the trial?</blockquote>
					</div>			
				</section>



				<!-- User Research -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Phase 2</h5>
							<h2>User Research</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Interviews</h3>
							<p>
								To probe deeper into needs of trial users, I collaborated with a UX researcher and <strong>interviewed 7 potential customers across 6 continents.</strong>
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/User demographics.jpg" alt="Customer locations" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">I interviewed customers across 6 continents to understand their needs during a product trial</h6><br/>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>User Personas</h3>
							<p>
								Based on interviews I developed 2 personas to highlight the trends in the data.
							</p>

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Personas.jpg" alt="Personas" /></div><br/><br/>
							<!-- <div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Persona1.jpg" alt="Persona of Sole Champion" /></div>

							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							In small orgs, users look for feature-set rather than UI. Their job responsiblities overlap. To learn more, they prefer documentation.<br/><br/>
							</p>

							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							In organization with large teams, users look for simple UI so they don’t spend time training employees who administer the platform.<br/><br/>
							</p>

							<ul class="actions special small">
								<li><a href="images/Nutanix/Detailed Personas.jpg" target="_blank" class="button alt small">See detailed personas</a></li>
							</ul>

							<!-- <div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Persona2.jpg" alt="Persona of team facilitator" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">Detailed persona of team facilitator</h6><br/> -->
							<hr/>
							<h3>Buyer Journey</h3>
							<p>
								I mapped typical actions customers take in their buying journey from the interviews.
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Buyer Journey.jpg" alt="Images: Buyer actions" /></div><br/>
							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							 Users collaborate with colleagues to evaluate a product. Require buy-in from multiple teams. Often have other priority items on list.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<blockquote>Users are collaborate to evaluate a platform, they are distracted, they don't have much time, how do I optimise trial for these constraints?</blockquote>
					</div>			
				</section>




				<!-- Divergence -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Phase 3</h5>
							<h2>Divergence and Evaluation</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Onboarding</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>The goal for onboarding</strong> was to provide users meaningful context to help them get started as fast as possible.<br/><br/>
								I considered various options:<br/>
								• Using user info like company or role upfront to customize the onboarding?<br/>
								• Having a video shown up upfront or onboarding screens?<br/>
								• Giving them 3 tutorials or providing them catalogue of tutorials?<br/>
							</p>


							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Onboarding option 1.jpg" alt="Onboarding options" /></div>
							<ul><li><hl>I decided to ask role information so users can be taken to the relevant section in the product right away. This feature was shipped as part of MVP.</hl></li></ul><br/>

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Onboarding option 2.jpg" alt="Onboarding options" /></div>
							<ul><li><hl>I decided not to start a video, because it would delay users in getting started with the product. Instead, I used onboarding screens to provide context.</hl></li></ul><br/>

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Onboarding option 3.jpg" alt="Onboarding options" /></div>
							<ul><li><hl>I decided to highlight important workflows to get started because not finding a business use-case would risk dropping-out early in the onboarding.</hl></li></ul><br/>

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Onboarding option 4.jpg" alt="Onboarding options" /></div>
							<ul><li><hl>I decided to give users option to get started with customized tutorials instead of a catalogue of tutorials which would overwhelm them.</hl></li></ul><br/>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>In-product guidance</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>The goal for in-product guidance</strong> was to help users understand the product without hampering their exploration workflow.<br/><br/>
								• I considered having short tutorials.<br/>
								• Showing them a progress card on dashboard with main actions like LinkedIn. <br/>
								• Using a popup to introduce a section.<br/>
								• Just opening up a new tab with documentation.<br/>
							</p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Guidance options.jpg" alt="Guidance options" /></div><br/>
							<ul>
								<li><hl>I decided to <strong>use self-paced tutorials as a way to educate trial users</strong> because I discovered sales team used the same approach in workshops to teach new customers about a product which was very effective.</hl></li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Tutorial options.jpg" alt="Tutorial options" /></div><br/>
							<ul>
								<li>I zeroed-in on two options, <hl>a floating panel</hl> which shows them tutorial instructions and a <hl>WalkMe bubble</hl> that walks them by through the instructions. I figured that <hl>both approaches accomplish the required goals.</hl> And so, <strong>I was stuck.</strong></li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Evaluation</h3>
							<p>
								To resolve the conflict, I prototyped a sample tutorial in both the approaches and conducted a <strong>within-subjects study with 7 users.</strong>
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/User feedback.jpg" alt="Image: User feedback" /></div><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Feedback graph.jpg" alt="Feedback graph" /></div>
							<blockquote>Participants found Panel approach more helpful because of it's flexiblity and ability to provide over-arching context...</blockquote>

				<!-- Learnings -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h2>What I learned</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>It starts out fuzzy, but keep at it and focus on the process:</strong> I was flustered initially because the problem space was technically challenging. However, as I started breaking down the problem, collect data, meeting PMs and leaders in the team to understand the business context, clarity started to emerge. One of the things that helped me throughout the internship was to stay laser-focussed on the user. Trying to understand their needs, pain-points, motivations helped me add tremendous value to the project.</li><br/>
								<li><strong>Get into field, validate assumptions:</strong> When I started out with the project, there were many unknowns. And to be able to make informed decisions, it is important to get into the field and speak with real people. I was skeptical about my decision to conduct user study initially, because of the tight internship timeline. However in retrospect, it was probably the best decision that added immense value to the quantitative data and defined future direction of the project.</li><br/>
								<li><strong>Involve stakeholders in the process:</strong> When I joined Nutanix, the product was being still being built. Over the course of my internship the business needs kept evolving as new factors of cost, feature, timeline came into consideration. One of the things that helped me to stay updated with the latest business decisions was to share my progress and findings with the stakeholders regularly. This not only helped me to figure where my findings make most sense but also create designs that accommodated evolving business needs.
