									In 2019, Nutanix (B2B cloud computing firm) made a massive shift from traditional term-based contract pricing to subscription-based pricing. Their customer acquisition strategy changed from cold-calling customers to offering self-serving product trials.<br/><br/>I was tasked with the critical responsiblity of reimagining their product trial experience.

						<h2>Designing for Growth</h2>
						<p>
							With enterprises shifting to cloud, just in 3 years market size doubled to <strong>$24B</strong>.

				<!-- What already exists -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
						<h5>Phase 1</h5>
						<h2>Starting with what exists</h2>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Existing trial experience</h3>
						<p>
							To understand what worked in existing trial, I conducted <strong>usability tests with 3 participants.</strong> I discovered major usability issues in the current experience.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Xi IoT Journey.jpg" alt="Xi Iot User Journey" /></div>

						Users explored product randomly because there was no guidance. And important options like help were buried deep in navigation.
						</p><br/>
						<!-- <div class="image fit" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #ebebeb; border-width: thin;"><img src="images/Nutanix/Xi IoT Trial.gif" alt="Xi IoT trial demo" /></div>

						<!-- <blockquote>I learnt that current trial experience wasn't working. It had to be redesigned from the ground up...</blockquote> -->
						<br/>

						<h3>Digging into data</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Last year's data</strong> revealed some interesting stats about user behavior in a trial.
						</p><br/>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Trial Data.jpg" alt="Image: Data analytics of Trial" /></div><br/>
						<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
						 On an average, users spent less than 11 minutes in a trial after they first logged in.
						</p><br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<hr/>
						<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Benchmarked direct and indirect competitors</strong> across sign-up, in-product trial and purchase phase against the existing trial experience.
						</p><br/>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Competitor Benchmarking.jpg" alt="Competitor Analysis" /></div>

						Openshift used short tutorial to onboard users, provided step-by-step instructions. Platform9 provided easily accessible in-product help.</p>

				<!-- User Research -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Phase 2</h5>
							<h2>User Research</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Interviews</h3>
							<p>
								To probe deeper into needs of trial users, I collaborated with a UX researcher and <strong>interviewed 7 potential customers across 6 continents.</strong>
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/User demographics.jpg" alt="Customer locations" /></div>
							<h6 style="text-align: center;">I interviewed customers across 6 continents to understand their needs during a product trial</h6><br/>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>User Personas</h3>
							<p>
								Based on interviews I developed 2 personas to highlight the trends in the data.
							</p>

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Personas.jpg" alt="Personas" /></div><br/><br/>
							<!-- <div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Persona1.jpg" alt="Persona of Sole Champion" /></div>

							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							In small orgs, users look for feature-set rather than UI. Their job responsiblities overlap. To learn more, they prefer documentation.<br/><br/>
							</p>

							<p><span class="image left" style="padding-right: 1.875rem"><img src="images/Nutanix/Insight icon.jpg" alt="Insight icon" style="width:60px"/></span>
							In organization with large teams, users look for simple UI so they don’t spend time training employees who administer the platform.<br/><br/>

							<h3>Conversion Journey</h3>
							<p>
								I mapped user-actions and user-context at various stages in customer's buying journey based on the interview data.

							 Users collaborate with colleagues to evaluate a product. Require buy-in from multiple teams. Often have other priority items on list.<br/><br/>
							</p>
							<blockquote>Users collaborate to evaluate a platform, they are distracted, they don't have much time, how do I optimise trial for these constraints?</blockquote>
					</div>

				<!-- Divergence -->
				<section class="container">
					<div class="box">
							<h5>Phase 3</h5>
							<h2>Divergence and Evaluation</h2>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Onboarding</h3>
							<p>
								I started with onboarding experience as one of the pain points was lack of guidance.<br/><br/>
								<strong>The goal for onboarding was twofold:</strong><br/>
								(1) Emphasize value proposition of the product relevant to the user.<br/>
								(2) Provide meaningful context quickly, as I found, users don't have much time.<br/><br/>
								
								<strong>I considered various options:</strong><br/>
								• Customize onboarding based on company or role information.<br/>
								• Using a video or onboarding to provide context.<br/>
								• Providing a tutorial or a catalogue of tutorials to get started.<br/>
							</p>


							<div class="image fit">
							<a data-fancybox="images" href="images/Nutanix/Onboarding options.jpg" data-caption="Low fidelity concept mocks for onboarding flow">
								<img src="images/Nutanix/Onboarding options.jpg" alt="Onboarding options" />
							</a>
							</div><br/>
							<ul>
								<li>When users started the trial, I asked their <hl>role info to customize onboarding.</hl> But I avoided <hl>company information as it wasn’t necessary</hl> for customization.</li><br/>
								<li>Videos are a good way to educate customers on website, but I preferred customized <hl>onboarding screens to communicate value proposition</hl> within product, as <hl>video would delay them</hl> in getting started.</li><br/>
								<li>Tutorials are great way of providing initial guidance to new users (reasons covered in next section). I decided to highlight a <hl>couple of relevant tutorials to get started</hl> instead of a <hl>tutorial catalogue, which would overwhelm new users</hl>.
							</ul><br/>


							<!-- Commenting the individual screens divergence -->

							<!-- <div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Onboarding option 1.jpg" alt="Onboarding options" /></div>
							<ul><li><hl>I decided to ask role information so users can be taken to the relevant section in the product right away. This feature was shipped as part of MVP.</hl></li></ul><br/>

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Onboarding option 2.jpg" alt="Onboarding options" /></div>
							<ul><li><hl>I decided not to start a video, because it would delay users in getting started with the product. Instead, I used onboarding screens to provide context.</hl></li></ul><br/>

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Onboarding option 3.jpg" alt="Onboarding options" /></div>
							<ul><li><hl>I decided to highlight important workflows to get started because not finding a business use-case would risk dropping-out early in the onboarding.</hl></li></ul><br/>

							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Nutanix/Onboarding option 4.jpg" alt="Onboarding options" /></div>
							<ul><li><hl>I decided to give users option to get started with customized tutorials instead of a catalogue of tutorials which would overwhelm them.</hl></li></ul><br/> -->
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>In-product guidance</h3>
							<p>
								Next I looked at in-product guidance, as I had discovered during usability tests that users were finding it hard to navigate the product.<br/><br/>
								<strong>The goal for in-product guidance</strong> was to help users navigate the product without hampering their exploration workflow.<br/><br/>
								<strong>I considered various options:</strong><br/>
								• Having short tutorials.<br/>
								• Showing progress card on dashboard with main actions like LinkedIn. <br/>
								• Using a popup to introduce a new section.<br/>
								• Just opening up a new tab with documentation.<br/>
							</p>
							<div class="image fit">
							<a data-fancybox="images" href="images/Nutanix/Guidance options.jpg" data-caption="Low fidelity concept mocks for in-product guidance">
								<img src="images/Nutanix/Guidance options.jpg" alt="Guidance options" />
							</a>
							</div><br/>
							<ul>
								<li><hl>I decided to use self-paced tutorials</hl> as a way to help trial users navigate a product because I discovered <hl>sales team used short tutorials in workshops</hl> to educate new customers about a product <hl>which were very effective.</hl></li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<div class="image fit">
							<a data-fancybox="images" href="images/Nutanix/Tutorial options.jpg" data-caption="Which interaction is better, Panel or WalkMe bubble?">
								<img src="images/Nutanix/Tutorial options.jpg" alt="Tutorial options" />
							</a>
							</div><br/>
							<ul>
								<li>I zeroed-in on two options, <hl>a floating panel with tutorial instructions</hl> and a <hl>WalkMe bubble that walks them through instructions one-by-one.</hl> I figured that <hl>both options accomplished required goals.</hl> And so, I was stuck.</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Evaluation</h3>
							<p>
								To resolve the conflict, I prototyped a sample tutorial in both the approaches and conducted a <strong>within-subjects study with 7 users.</strong>
							</p><br/>
							<div class="image fit">
							<a data-fancybox="images" href="images/Nutanix/Figma Prototype.png" data-caption="Sample tutorial prototype for Panel and WalkMe interactions in Figma">

							<h5>Phase 4</h5>
							<h2>Final Designs</h2>

							Mid-point during the internship, business strategy pivoted from it’s decided path. I was dejected initially to find that my designs were no longer achievable in the available time and resource constraints.<br/><br/>
							<strong>I was faced with a tough choice:</strong><br/>
							Should I keep working on the ideal user experience or should I ditch my work and start over?<br/><br/>
							To resolve the dilemma, I <hl>developed the ideal product trial experience</hl> based on the evaluation data and subsequently, utilized my learnings to <hl>create minimum viable designs which could be shipped</hl> for the product launch.

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>It starts out fuzzy, but keep at it and focus on the process:</strong> I was flustered initially because of complex problem space. However, as I understood business and user goals, clarity emerged. Staying laser-focussed on the user helped me add crucial value to the project.</li><br/>
								<li><strong>Get into field, validate assumptions:</strong> I started out with many unknowns. User interviews were necessary to bring clarity but could've stretched the project timeline. Nevertheless, I decided to conduct them. In retrospect, they helped me understand complete user journey and make informed decisions.</li><br/>
								<li><strong>Involve stakeholders in the process:</strong> The business needs kept evolving over the course of my internship. Regularly sharing my work with the leadership helped me think more strategically. I was able to better support my team at the same time not compromise on the product's experience.
